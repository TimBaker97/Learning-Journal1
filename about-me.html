I desire to implement and utilise my skills developed throughout my degree and put them into a computational software setting, to further develop this hobby.</p>

            <h4 class="article-highlighted-text">How I stay committed to learning</h4>
            <p class="article-text">I am relatively new to the feld of tech and computer science. I find the idea of watching work come to life in front of you extremely rewarding and motivating. Creating simple projects and using what I've learned or implementing new techniques into existing projects is what maintains the enjoyment. While that is fun, I felt like it would be progressive to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h4 class="article-highlighted-text">How I got started</h4>
            <p class="article-text"></p>
            I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words. That helped me develop what I was learning, and I realised that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
